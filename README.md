# Lock-Screen-Pull
This script copies the Windows 10 lock screen files to a location where you can sort out and keep your favorites


## How to use
1. Download `pull.bat` and `imgInfo.bat`, or clone repository. 
2. Optional: Change setup location inside of `pull.bat`. It is set as the variable `DIRECTORY` and the default is `"%USERPROFILE%\Pictures"`. Additionally, change the `LOCATION` variable which is by default set to `"Lock Screens\"`. This will set up everything in a "Lock Screens" folder in your user's Pictures directory. 
3. Run `pull.bat` from anywhere. It will use the configured setup location. `imgInfo.bat` should be inside the setup `LOCATION` if you downloaded it manually. The script will try to move it into the `LOCATION` directory automatically. 
4. Open the `dump\` folder and delete any advertisement/spam images that Windows downloaded and sort out favorite images. 
5. Remaining images inside `dump\`, `horizontal\`, and `vertical\` can be deleted or moved. 
- It is recommended to `SHIFT + DELETE` unwanted images. It deletes them permanently but will reduce disk usage. 

## Recommended tips
- You can set your desktop background to shuffle through the `horizontal\` folder, or move your favorites out and set the background to cycle through those instead. 
- Use the Windows run box (`Win+R`) to run the script (`"%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Lock Screens\pull.bat"`) should work if you didn't change the default location. 

## Generated Files/Folders:
- `lock screens\` (or changed by updating the `LOCATION` variable)
the main program folder containing all processed images, files, and folders  

- `horizontal\` & `vertical\`
empty folders used to separate the 1920x1080 and 1080x1920 images  

- `dump\`
where all of the processed images are placed, ready for manual sorting  

- `trash.txt`
a list of already processed images to reduce the likelihood of getting duplicates  

- `temp\`
to be removed after operations, a temp to convert image files  


## Features/TODO
- [x] Automatically set up directory
- [x] Remove images that have been seen previously
- [x] Create custom setup location variable
- [x] Automatically remake and remove `temp\` before and after operations
- [x] Sort images by vertical vs horizontal
